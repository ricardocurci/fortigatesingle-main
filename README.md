## Description

Deploy a single BYOL FortiGate in IBM Cloud using the Schematics service.

## Deployment overview

> **Note:** For a local deployment a Gen 2 API key will be needed. For details see: [IBM Gen 2 API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key)

This deployment requires that you already have the following already configured:

-   A VPC
-   Two subnets
-   An ssh key

Terraform deploys the following components:

-   A FortiGate BYOL instance with two NICs, one in each subnet
-   A Floating Public IP address attached to the FortiGate
-   A Logging disk
